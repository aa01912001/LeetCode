題號: 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
難度: Easy

## 問題描述

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned **in front** of the civilians. That is, all the `1`'s will appear to the **left** of all the 0's in each row.

A row `i` is **weaker** than a row `j` if one of the following is true:

- The number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`.
- Both rows have the same number of soldiers and `i < j`.

Return the indices of the `k` **weakest** rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].
```
**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `2 <= n, m <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= m`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.

## 解決思路

此題我們可透過min heap來記錄每一row的1個數與其index，最後再從heap中取出`k`個row之index即可。
