題號: 1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees
難度: Medium

## 問題描述

A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the `manager` array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.
The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.
```
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= headID < n`
- `manager.length == n`
- `0 <= manager[i] < n`
- `manager[headID] == -1`
- `informTime.length == n`
- `0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000`
- `informTime[i] == 0` if employee `i` has no subordinates.
- It is **guaranteed** that all the employees can be informed.

## 解決思路

此題相當於去找出tree中所有從root到leaf的路徑中，最長的inform time path；因此，一開始我們可透過`manager`來建立directed graph，並利用DFS策略來找出所有的路徑，過程中只需要更新解答之最長的inform time之值即可。
