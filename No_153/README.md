題號: 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
難度: Medium

## 問題描述

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

## 解決思路

此題我們只需要利用binary search來尋找最小數，一旦：

- `nums[mid] < nums[n-1]`，則`right = mid`。
- `nums[mid] > nums[n-1]`，則`left = mid + 1`。

其中，`n`為`nums`長度
